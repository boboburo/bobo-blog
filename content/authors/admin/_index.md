I have had the joy of working in the emerging area of Machine Learning for a number of different companies and teams for the last decade; mostly recenlty leading teams in ML delivery in areas such as ASR, NLP and Forecasting. 

<!-- I am currently a Director of Machine Learning for the Advanced Technology Collaboration in Optum Ireland. Mostly recently I have been working as Software Delivery Lead for ML projects in areas such as ASR, NLP and Forecasting. Previously I have worked as a hands on ML Engineer.-->

I love working with data, understanding it and  visualizing it. I am also very driven by building end-to-end ML projects and getting value from ML through good project definition in combination with early and frequent delivery. I work with R and Python mainly and a number of development environments. 

This blog reflects my passions and learnings around ML and is also a placeholder for my learnings. Hopeully you might find some of the posts interesting and/or useful.  All views are my own. 

When I am not delving into some ML pursuit, I enjoy cooking, traveling (when possible), weight lifting, hiking and reading. 

Thanks for landing here and have a good day. *Brian*
