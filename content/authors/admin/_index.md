Thanks for landing on my blog. I have been working in Machine Learning/Data Science for the best part of a decade; both as an individual contributor and more recenlty leading teams in ML delivery in areas such as ASR, NLP and Forecasting. 

<!-- I am currently a Director of Machine Learning for the Advanced Technology Collaboration in Optum Ireland. Mostly recently I have been working as Software Delivery Lead for ML projects in areas such as ASR, NLP and Forecasting. Previously I have worked as a hands on ML Engineer.-->

I enjoy working with data, understanding it and  visualizing it. I am also very driven by building end-to-end ML projects and getting value from ML through good project definition in combination with early and frequent delivery. I work with R and Python mainly and a number of development environments. 

This blog reflects my passions and learning around ML and is also a placeholder for me to jot down process and try out new tools. Hopefully you might find some of the posts interesting and/or useful. 

When I am not delving into some ML pursuit, I enjoy cooking, traveling (when possible), weight lifting, hiking and reading. 

Have a good day and enjoy browsing. *Brian*
