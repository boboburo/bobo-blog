abstract: Pillreports.net is an on-line database of reviews of Ecstasy pills. In consumer theory illicit drugs are experience goods, in that the contents are not known until the time of consumption. Websites like Pillreports.net, may be viewed as an attempt to bridge that gap, as well as highlighting instances, where a particular pill is producing undesirable effects. This talk will present the experiences and insights from a text mining project using data scraped from the Pillreports.net site.
