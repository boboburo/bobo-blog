# bobo-blog

This is contains the code for my personal blog www.bobo-buro.com hosted on netifly. The blog scaffold was created using [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).
It is a static site, but I may link to deployed applications. The site is the **hugo-academic** theme from [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com)

It is possible to create blog post within RStudio or from command line. The README is a holding place for commands that I might forget. 

## Hugo Command Line

```bash
hugo new post/first-post.md
```
